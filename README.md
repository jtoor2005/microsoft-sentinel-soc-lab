# Microsoft Sentinel SIEM/SOAR Lab



\## Overview



This project demonstrates an end to end Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) lab built using Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Sentinel.



The objective of this lab was to simulate a Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow by collecting Windows Security Events, detecting failed login attempts using Kusto Query Language (KQL), generating Microsoft Sentinel incidents, and automating incident response using Azure Logic Apps.

\- Azure Monitor Agent

\- Azure Virtual Machine

\- Azure Logic Apps

\- Kusto Query Language (KQL)

\- Windows Security Event Logs



\---



\## Project Workflow



\### 1. Deploy Infrastructure



\- Created an Azure Resource Group.

\- Created a Windows Server 2022 Virtual Machine.

\- Created a Log Analytics Workspace.

\- Enabled Microsoft Sentinel.



\### 2. Configure Data Collection



\- Installed Azure Monitor Agent.

\- Created a Data Collection Rule.

\- Collected Windows Security Events.



\### 3. Threat Detection



Created several KQL queries to investigate authentication events including:



\- Recent Security Events

\- Failed Login Events

\- Failed Login Summary

\- Multiple Failed Login Detection

\- Failed Login Trend



\### 4. Analytics Rule



Created a scheduled Analytics Rule that detects multiple failed Windows logins within a five minute period and automatically creates a Microsoft Sentinel Incident.



Severity:



\- Medium



Detection:



\- Event ID 4625

\- Five or more failed login attempts within five minutes



\### 5. Incident Investigation



Generated failed Windows logins on the virtual machine.



Verified:



\- Alert generation

\- Incident creation

\- Incident investigation inside Microsoft Sentinel



\### 6. SOAR Automation



Created an Azure Logic App playbook that automatically sends an email whenever the Analytics Rule creates a new Microsoft Sentinel incident.



Successfully validated:



\- Logic App execution

\- Automated email notification
